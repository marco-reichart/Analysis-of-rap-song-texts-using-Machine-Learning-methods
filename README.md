# Analysis-of-rap-song-texts-using-Machine-Learning-methods
This repository focuses on analysing rap song texts with different Machine Learning methods. Part of the repository is from the project, which was developed together with Christian Engelhard, for the module Text Analytics of our bachelor at the Nuremberg Tech University Georg Simon Ohm. In this project we classified rap song texts as implicit and explicit.
